# Staff-Scheduling-Problem

As Senior operation manager, your job is to optimize scarce resources, improve productivity, reduce cost and maximize profit. For example, scheduling workersâ€™ shifts for the most effective utilization of manpower. We need to consider the various restrictions of the total working hours of each employee, the number of shifts, shift hours, and other constraints. Such a problem can be considered an optimization problem.

Staff or workforce scheduling is used in numerous use-cases like nurse staff scheduling in a hospital, air flight scheduling, staff scheduling in the hotel, and scheduling of drivers. Such schedules can be created based on various time periods like hours, days, weeks, and months. Various organizations use spreadsheets and software. Poorly managed schedule causes overlapping of employee allocation, no breaks between shifts. Ultimately it will cause poor employee performance. For effective workforce scheduling, we need to consider the number of constraints and formulate them in the right manner. Workforce scheduling will help in effective human resource utilization, balanced timing, balanced workload, reduce employee fatigue and give importance to individual preferences.
